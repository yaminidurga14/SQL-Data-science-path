" Can IFNULL() replace COALESCE()?"


Yes, but only when there are two arguments. For example, IFNULL(salary, 0) and COALESCE(salary, 0) are equivalent in MySQL. 
However, COALESCE() is more flexible because it can accept multiple arguments and return the first non-NULL value. 
It's also part of the SQL standard, making it more portable across different database systems.

SQL compares:

First row:

Retail = Retail ✅

Matches.

Second row:
2024 = 2024 ✅
NULL = NULL ❌

This does not match because in SQL,
NULL = NULL
is UNKNOWN, not TRUE.
So the second row is not joined.

Using ISNULL()

Now SQL evaluates	
ISNULL(a.type, '')

If type is NULL

↓

Replace with

''

Likewise

ISNULL(b.type, '')

also becomes

''

Now SQL compares

'' = ''

which is TRUE

So the rows join successfully.

Evaluation

Instead of:

NULL = NULL ❌

SQL actually evaluates

ISNULL(NULL,'') = ISNULL(NULL,'')

↓

'' = ''

↓

TRUE

-- --Handling null data, while sorting

-- In MySQL, NULL is treated as the smallest value, so it appears first when sorting ascending.

-- Ascending order

SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC;

-- Descending order
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Controlling the Position of NULLs

-- Put NULLs Last in Ascending Order

/*

1.First Sorting Condition (salary IS NOT NULL): 
The database evaluates this boolean expression for every row before doing anything else. 

If a row has a salary, salary IS NOT NULL evaluates to TRUE (which SQL treats numerically as 1).

If a row lacks a salary, salary IS NOT NULL evaluates to FALSE (which SQL treats numerically as 0). 

Because ORDER BY defaults to ascending order (ASC), it sorts 0 before 1. 

The Problem: This means FALSE (0) comes first, putting NULL salaries at the top.

The Fix: To get valid salaries at the top, you must reverse this logic by explicitly stating salary IS
NOT NULL DESC (since 1 comes before 0 in descending order). 

Note: In the query provided (ORDER BY salary IS NOT NULL), the absence of DESC means it is sorting in ascending order.
If the goal was to push NULL values to the bottom, the syntax should technically be ORDER BY salary IS NOT NULL DESC, salary DESC;. 

2. Second Sorting Condition (salary DESC)
salary DESC: This acts as a tie-breaker.
For all rows where the first condition evaluated to TRUE (all valid salaries), it sorts them from the highest amount to the lowest amount.

A NULL represents an unknown value.

SQL cannot determine whether two unknown values are equal.
