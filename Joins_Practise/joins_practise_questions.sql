/*
How and when to use Join??

1. What data is required?

Example:

customer name
payment mode

2. Which tables contain it?

Example:
customers
payments

3. How are tables connected?

Example:
customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id

orders.order_id = payments.order_id
The Universal JOIN Formula

Almost every JOIN question follows this pattern:

SELECT needed_columns
FROM first_table
JOIN second_table
ON relation
JOIN third_table
ON relation
WHERE condition;

===========================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY WHICH JOIN TO USE
===========================================================

CORE IDEA:
-----------
Ask yourself:

"Should unmatched rows appear in the result?"

IF NO:
-------
Use INNER JOIN

IF YES:
--------
Use LEFT JOIN


===========================================================
1. INNER JOIN
===========================================================

Meaning:
--------
Returns ONLY matching rows from both tables.

Use When:
----------
- You only need related data
- Missing records are not important

Common Question Patterns:
-------------------------
- Show customer orders
- Find purchased products
- Show payments for orders
- Display shipment details

Example:
---------
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

Result:
--------
Only customers having orders will appear.


===========================================================
2. LEFT JOIN
===========================================================

Meaning:
--------
Returns:
- ALL rows from LEFT table
- Matching rows from RIGHT table
- NULL for missing matches

Use When:
----------
- Need all records from left table
- Need missing/nonmatching data
- Need NULL analysis

Common Question Patterns:
-------------------------
- Find customers without orders
- Find products never sold
- Find orders without payments
- Find employees without orders
- Include all customers

Example:
---------
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

Result:
--------
All customers appear.
Customers without orders get NULL values.


===========================================================
3. RIGHT JOIN
===========================================================

Meaning:
--------
Opposite of LEFT JOIN.

Returns:
- ALL rows from RIGHT table
- Matching rows from LEFT table

Rarely used in industry.

Usually rewritten as LEFT JOIN.


===========================================================
4. FULL OUTER JOIN
===========================================================

Meaning:
--------
Returns:
- Matching rows
- Nonmatching left rows
- Nonmatching right rows

Used in:
---------
- PostgreSQL
- Snowflake
- BigQuery

Not directly supported in MySQL.


===========================================================
5. CROSS JOIN
===========================================================

Meaning:
--------
Creates every possible combination.

Example:
---------
3 customers × 4 products = 12 rows

Used rarely.


===========================================================
QUICK DECISION TABLE
===========================================================

Question Type                           JOIN Type
---------------------------------------------------------
Show matching data                      INNER JOIN
Find products purchased                 INNER JOIN
Show payments for orders                INNER JOIN
Find customers without orders           LEFT JOIN
Find products never sold                LEFT JOIN
Find orders without shipment            LEFT JOIN
Include all customers                   LEFT JOIN


===========================================================
MOST IMPORTANT RULE
===========================================================

Need only matching rows?
------------------------
INNER JOIN

Need missing/unmatched rows too?
--------------------------------
LEFT JOIN
