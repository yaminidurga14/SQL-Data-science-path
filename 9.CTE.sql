-- CTE [ Common Table Expressions 

/*

A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary result set that you can define within a query and 
then reference like a table. It makes complex queries easier to read, organize, and reuse.

Syntax:

WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT *
FROM cte_name;




1. Improves Readability
Instead of deeply nested subqueries, you break logic into steps.

2. Reusability in Same Query
You can reference the CTE multiple times.

3. Recursive Queries
CTEs support recursion (very powerful for hierarchical data like trees).

SELECT *
FROM dim_product
WHERE unit_price > (SELECT AVG(unit_price) FROM dim_product)
ORDER BY unit_price ASC;

WITH cte_table AS
(
SELECT *
FROM dim_product
WHERE unit_price > (SELECT AVG(unit_price) FROM dim_product)
ORDER BY unit_price ASC
)
SELECT * FROM cte_table
WHERE product_name='Trade Onto';

-----------------------------------------

-- chained CTE , A chained CTE means one CTE uses the result of a previous CTE.

WITH cte_table AS
(
SELECT *
FROM dim_product
WHERE unit_price > (SELECT AVG(unit_price) FROM dim_product)
ORDER BY unit_price ASC
),

cte_table2 AS 
(
SELECT * FROM cte_table
WHERE product_name IN ('Figure Method','Huge Change', 'Film Finally')
)

SELECT * FROM cte_table2
WHERE product_name='Figure Method';





--  CTE + Window Functions
-- The most common real-world CTE pattern: compute a ranking/row number inside
-- the CTE, then FILTER on it in the outer query (you cannot filter a window
-- function directly in WHERE).
-- Syntax: WITH c AS (SELECT ..., ROW_NUMBER() OVER(...) rn FROM t) SELECT * FROM c WHERE rn = 1


-- Rank products by price within each category, then keep only rank 1
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT product_name, category, unit_price,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY unit_price DESC) AS price_rank

CREATE TABLE employees (

Starting `employees` table

| emp_id | emp_name   | manager_id |
| -----: | ---------- | ---------: |
|      1 | CEO        |       NULL |
|      2 | VP Sales   |          1 |
|      3 | VP Tech    |          1 |
|      4 | Sales Lead |          2 |
|      5 | Engineer   |          3 |
|      6 | Analyst    |          4 |

And the recursive CTE is:

WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (

    -- Anchor
    SELECT emp_id, emp_name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive part
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_chart oc
        ON e.manager_id = oc.emp_id
)
SELECT *
FROM org_chart;


ITERATION 0 — Anchor

The anchor runs only once:


SELECT emp_id, emp_name, manager_id, 1 AS level
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL


SQL searches `employees`:


Who has manager_id = NULL?


Answer:
CEO


So:
org_chart
┌────────┬────────┬────────────┬───────┐
│ emp_id │ name   │ manager_id │ level │
├────────┼────────┼────────────┼───────┤
│ 1      │ CEO    │ NULL       │ 1     │
└────────┴────────┴────────────┴───────┘


This is our starting point.



ITERATION 1 — Find CEO's children

Now the recursive part runs.


SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
FROM employees e
JOIN org_chart oc
    ON e.manager_id = oc.emp_id


Currently `org_chart` contains:

CEO
emp_id = 1
level = 1


The JOIN says:

e.manager_id = oc.emp_id


So:


e.manager_id = 1


SQL looks in `employees`:

| emp_id | emp_name | manager_id |
| -----: | -------- | ---------: |
|      2 | VP Sales |      **1** |
|      3 | VP Tech  |      **1** |

Therefore, iteration 1 produces:


2 | VP Sales | 1 | 2
3 | VP Tech  | 1 | 2


Why level 2?


oc.level + 1
1 + 1 = 2


Now the CTE has:

org_chart

1 | CEO      | NULL | 1
2 | VP Sales | 1    | 2
3 | VP Tech  | 1    | 2




ITERATION 2 — Find their children

This is the important one

Now the recursive process takes the newly discovered rows:


2 | VP Sales | 1 | 2
3 | VP Tech  | 1 | 2


and uses them as `oc`.

First `oc` row

oc.emp_id = 2
oc.level = 2


JOIN:
e.manager_id = oc.emp_id


becomes:
e.manager_id = 2


Look in `employees`:
4 | Sales Lead | 2


So:

4 | Sales Lead | 2 | 3


---

Second `oc` :

oc.emp_id = 3
oc.level = 2

JOIN becomes:


e.manager_id = 3


Look in `employees`:


5 | Engineer | 3


So:


5 | Engineer | 3 | 3


Therefore **iteration 2 produces**:


4 | Sales Lead | 2 | 3
5 | Engineer   | 3 | 3


Now we have:


org_chart

1 | CEO         | NULL | 1
2 | VP Sales    | 1    | 2
3 | VP Tech     | 1    | 2
4 | Sales Lead  | 2    | 3
5 | Engineer    | 3    | 3


---

 ITERATION 3 — Find their children

Now the newly found rows are:


4 | Sales Lead | 2 | 3
5 | Engineer   | 3 | 3


Again:

sql
e.manager_id = oc.emp_id


 For Sales Lead


oc.emp_id = 4


Therefore:


e.manager_id = 4


Find in employees:


6 | Analyst | 4


So:


6 | Analyst | 4 | 4


 For Engineer


oc.emp_id = 5


Therefore:


e.manager_id = 5


Nobody has `manager_id = 5`.

So iteration 3 produces only:


6 | Analyst | 4 | 4


Now:


org_chart

1 | CEO         | NULL | 1
2 | VP Sales    | 1    | 2
3 | VP Tech     | 1    | 2
4 | Sales Lead  | 2    | 3
5 | Engineer    | 3    | 3
6 | Analyst     | 4    | 4


---

 ITERATION 4 — Find Analyst's children

Now the new row is:

6 | Analyst | 4 | 4


The JOIN becomes:
e.manager_id = 6


Look at employees:
Who has manager_id = 6?


Nobody.

Therefore:


Iteration 4 → 0 rows

And now recursion stops**.

---

 Where exactly does `UNION ALL` fit?

This is very important.

`UNION ALL` combines the output of each stage.

Think of it as:


ANCHOR
  ↓
CEO
  +
ITERATION 1
  ↓
VP Sales, VP Tech
  +
ITERATION 2
  ↓
Sales Lead, Engineer
  +
ITERATION 3
  ↓
Analyst
  +
ITERATION 4
  ↓
Nothing


So the final CTE is:


CEO
VP Sales
VP Tech
Sales Lead
Engineer
Analyst


Or with levels:


Level 1 → CEO

Level 2 → VP Sales
           VP Tech

Level 3 → Sales Lead
           Engineer

Level 4 → Analyst


---

 The key rule to remember

Anchor runs once.

Recursive part repeatedly takes the newly found rows and joins them back to `employees` to find their children.


Current org_chart rows
        ↓
JOIN employees
        ↓
Find children
        ↓
UNION ALL
        ↓
Add children to result
        ↓
Use those children in next iteration
        ↓
Repeat


That's the entire mechanism of your recursive CTE.

-- CTE vs SUBQUERY

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Written inside another query        | Defined at the top with `WITH`        |
| Can become hard to read when nested | Easier to read and organize           |
| Good for simple queries             | Better for multi-step transformations |
| May repeat the same logic           | Define once, reuse multiple times     |
| Often used for one-off calculations | Common in ETL and analytics pipelines |

/*
Situation 1: Repeated Logic

-Subquery repeats the same aggregation.

SUM(total_amount)
GROUP BY store_key

appears multiple times.

Move it into a CTE.


Multiple Transformations:

Instead of deeply nested subqueries:

Subquery
    ↓
Subquery
    ↓
Subquery

write:

sales
    ↓
store_revenue
    ↓
region_revenue
    ↓
final_result

Each step has a meaningful name.

Readability: Complex logic is broken into named steps.
Maintainability: Repeated logic is written once.
Reusability: The same intermediate result can be referenced multiple times in the query.
Debugging: You can inspect each transformation step independently during development.
ETL suitability: Multi-step data transformations are much easier to express with chained CTEs.

One important clarification: a CTE is not automatically faster than a subquery.
Modern database optimizers often produce the same execution plan for equivalent queries. 
The primary reason to choose a CTE is usually clarity and maintainability, not performance.
