-- WINDOW FUNCTION

/*

Window Functions let you perform calculations across a set of rows related to the  'current row'  without collapsing 
the result into a single row like GROUP BY.

- It performs a calculation over a window '(subset) of rows' while still keeping individual rows.


Syntax:

function_name() OVER(
    PARTITION BY column
    ORDER BY column
    ROWS/RANGE frame
)

This has 4 major parts:

Function
OVER()
PARTITION BY
ORDER BY
ROWS / RANGE (window frame)

Components of Window Functions:

Window Function mainly has these components:

1. FUNCTION

This is the operation SQL performs.

Examples:

| Function Type | Examples                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Aggregate     | SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX    |
| Ranking       | ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK |
| Analytical    | LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE       |


Example:
SUM(salary)

Means:
Calculate total salary.

But SQL still doesn't know:
over which rows?
grouped how?
ordered how?

That is handled by OVER().


2. OVER()

This is the MOST IMPORTANT component.

It defines:
Which rows belong to the window.

Without OVER(), SQL treats functions normally.

*/

-- Normal Aggregate

SELECT SUM(unit_price)
FROM dim_product;

-- returns one row.


-- Windows Function

SELECT
    *,
    SUM(unit_price) OVER()
FROM dim_product;

-- Now:

-- rows are preserved
-- calculation happens over a window

/*

What OVER() Can  ?

OVER(
    PARTITION BY ...
    ORDER BY ...
    ROWS/RANGE ...
)

it's like:

OVER(
   divide rows,
   sort rows,
   choose rows
)


3. PARTITION BY

This divides rows into groups.

VERY SIMILAR to GROUP BY.

BUT:
rows are NOT collapsed

Example Table:
| emp | dept | salary |
| --- | ---- | ------ |
| A   | IT   | 100    |
| B   | IT   | 200    |
| C   | HR   | 300    |

*/

SELECT
    product_name,
    brand,
    category,
    unit_price,
    SUM(unit_price) OVER( PARTITION BY category ) AS Total
FROM dim_product;

/*

4. ORDER BY Inside OVER()

This defines order INSIDE each partition.

Very important for:

ranking
running totals
lag/lead
moving averages
*/


SELECT
    product_name,
    brand,
    category,
    unit_price,
	launch_date,
    SUM(unit_price) OVER( ORDER BY  launch_date) AS Total
FROM dim_product;

/*

5. ROWS / RANGE (Window Frame)

This defines:

EXACTLY which rows participate in calculation.

This is called:

frame clause
sliding window

Example:
ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW


Means:
Take:
2 previous rows
+ current row

| Keyword             | Meaning              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| CURRENT ROW         | Current row          |
| UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | Start from first row |
| UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING | Till last row        |
| 2 PRECEDING         | 2 rows before        |
| 3 FOLLOWING         | 3 rows after         |

SELECT *FROM dim_product;

    AVG(unit_price)

-- Normal Aggregate

-- Problem: Original rows are lost

SELECT category, AVG(unit_price) AS Avg_unit_price
FROM dim_product
GROUP BY category;



-- Window Function Version

SELECT category,
      AVG(unit_price) OVER(ORDER BY unit_price) as Avg_unit_price

SELECT *,
     SUM(unit_price) OVER(ORDER BY unit_price) AS Running_sum
FROM 
     dim_product; 
 
 /*
 
Internal Processing:

Row 1: 100
SUM = 100

Row 2: 200
SUM = 100 + 200=300

Row 3: 300
SUM = 100 + 200 + 300

SUM = 600
